# Scrap Bots

## Getting Started
You spawn inside a snug arena as a cobbled-together combat bot with a pea-shooter and **100 HP**.  
Move with **W A S D**, aim with the mouse, and hold **Left-Click** to fire.  
Every enemy you destroy refunds **5 HP**—aggression literally keeps you alive.

## The Combat Phase
Each wave unleashes a pack of drones that sprint straight toward you.  
Contact costs **15 HP**, but a built-in **0.6 s** invulnerability after every hit prevents insta-death.  
Kite the mob, keep the bullets flowing, and watch your health seesaw upward as kills roll in.

## The Build Phase
Once the arena is clear, the game flips to a **12-second breather**.  
One glowing part drops in the centre—walk over it to scoop it into your backpack.  
Press the number keys to socket items:

* **1** Head  **2** Chassis  **3** Left Arm  **4** Right Arm  **5** Legs  

Installed parts are permanent for the run; when the timer hits zero the next wave begins.

## Body-Part Timeline
| Wave | Part | Boost |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Laser Arm** (cyan) | Piercing hitscan beam on a rapid cooldown |
| 2 | **Light Chassis** (orange) | +100 HP (total cap = 200) & +30 speed |
| 3 | **Booster Legs** (green) | +45 speed for slick dodging |
| 4 | **Blaster Arm** (purple) | 5-pellet shotgun spread |
| 5 | **Radar Head** (blue) | −0.05 s fire-delay (~20 % faster fire rate) |

### Full-Set Power Surge  
With **all five** slots filled every shot also fires:

* three piercing laser beams in a fan  
* a seven-bullet scatter burst  

Crowds evaporate; the arena rains scrap.

## Boss Showdown — Wave 6
A towering magenta summoner appears, rooted in place.  
Every **3 s** it belches **15 minions** from random edges—ignore the boss until you thin the swarm.  
Then pour on your laser-fan scatter combo. Its **40 000 HP** melts under sustained fire.

## Survive, Restart, Repeat
Use kill-heals to stay topped up, leverage your speed buffs to outrun danger, and press **R** after any **YOU DIED** or **BOSS DOWN** banner to dive straight back into wave 1 for another scrap-bot sprint.
